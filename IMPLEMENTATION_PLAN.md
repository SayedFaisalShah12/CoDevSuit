# CoDevSuite Implementation Plan

CoDevSuite is an AI-powered developer productivity tool designed to reduce code complexity and provide deep insights into software architecture.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Static Analysis [COMPLETED]
- [x] Initialize project structure and environment.
- [x] Implement AST-powered code parser.
- [x] Integrate complexity metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Metrics).
- [x] Create a basic CLI for file analysis.

## Phase 2: Structural Analysis & Code Smells [COMPLETED]
- [x] Implement dependency graph generation (imports analysis).
- [x] Develop rule-based code smell detection (long methods, large classes, deep nesting).
- [x] Identify potential bugs (unused variables, reachable code).

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Insights [COMPLETED]
- [x] Integrate LLM (Gemini/OpenAI) for code explanation.
- [x] Implement AI refactoring suggestions.
- [x] Add performance and readability optimization hints.

## Phase 4: Visualization & UX [COMPLETED]
- [x] Build a rich CLI dashboard.
- [x] Develop a Web-based interface (Streamlit).
- [x] Generate visual dependency and complexity charts.

## Phase 5: Documentation & Examples [COMPLETED]
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation.
- [x] Provide example analyses and case studies.
- [x] Document extensibility for other languages.
